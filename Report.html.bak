    <h2> As part of my web development module, I was assigned the task of creating my own webpage.<br> This being my first semester, the assignment seemed very daunting at first but<br>I gave my best to come up with the final product, which I personally feel is pretty good.<br>

As you open the webpage, you can see the home page that contains home,<br> portfolio, blog, contact, and report tabs with my introduction on a linear-gradient background. <br>As for my portfolio, I have used grid-layout. <br>Talking about my blog, it has two sections, the first section has <br>two divisions for text. 
I opted to use pink, purple, violet, and aqua as background colors<br> as these enhanced my pages and created a good contrast against the font colors.<br>
 I did struggle a little while creating the portfolio and the contact page, the assistance, and guidance from my tutors and classmates helped me get through the task.
 Moving to the experience, I was a lit bit nervous because it was the first time I was using<br> HTML, coding, designs, and debugging.
 Everything was new for me.<br> I understood some basics of web developments through daily classes.
 I had missed <br>some classes and it was really hard for me to catch up. 
 <br>I was having some issues so I started learning via youtube, doing this daily<br> helped me gain the confidence to do the task at hand. 
 I had some confusion regarding pages<br> for which I sought help from my tutors. Also, they helped me with coding, GitHub, and CSS.<br>
 I have used java-script fot hamburger-icon.((Adam navy, 2021)<br>
<br>Overall it was a great learning experience.
 I learned a lot and<br> had a lot of fun too along the way. I really appreciate all the support<br> I received from my tutors, instructors. 
 During the course<br> of this assignment, I have definitely gained confidence along with knowledge<br> regarding web development and hope to accomplish more tasks like <br>this in the future.
